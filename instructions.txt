Hello Junior Agent My name is ROCO the Crocodile!

As a fellow member of the Super Secret Spy Agency, 
I congratulate you on scoring your first ever mission 
assignment out on the field! Your job is to get the 
[SUPER SECRET FILES] from the enemy spy’s base.
It won’t be easy, there are plenty of bad guys out there 
to be weary of...

Make decisions by using your [KEYBOARD.]

If you get stuck on a choice press the ‘T’ key for a hint. 
And remember every choice you make impacts the mission.

Who knows you might even learn a thing or two about 
[DIGITAL SAFETY] along the way! 

Good Luck out there Junior Agent!
