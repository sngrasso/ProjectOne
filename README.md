### Overview
State machine that iterates through different states in response to user choices. Done in the theme of a very simple "Choose-your-own-adventure" surrounding the theme of cyber safety for kids. 


### Technical Details

Assets loaded in preload before setup() is called. As draw() is constantly called, program waits for user input to change states. It implements state machine through conditional statements and keyboard pressed responses from user caught using keyPressed(). p5.timer library is used for some interactive states.
